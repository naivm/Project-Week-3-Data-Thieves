## Project Description

With this project we are trying to show if there is any correlation between the ranking of the happiest countries and income inequality. We also try to see if the happiest countries are the ones receiving the most migrants to see if the happiness index as a sort of good publicity effect.

## Hypotheses / Questions

Check if the coutries that are in the top 10 and bottom ten of the happiness index are also the least and most unequal respectively

## Dataset

We got from Kaggle the world happiness report (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness) then we found an API that had some of the data for the Gini coefficient (https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/countrycode?fields=gini;name) and we complemented it with the World bank API (http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?format=json). The Migration data set was removed from a .csv file from the United Nations Population division. (https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimates17.asp)

## Workflow

We first saw what were the most interesting data sets in Kaggle. With a couple selected we tried to see if there were any good API that had information that might correlate to our selected Kaggle data set. After testing several APIs for their limitations we settled for the above described APIS. Then we proceeded to clean and manipulate the data to merge all the data sets.
Finally we did some visualizations and drew some conclusions.

## Organization


We used Treelo to lay out a plan and then we saw what took the most time and used some pair programming to tackle the larger data set. And slack to keep everyone in touch.
